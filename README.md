Hello - We would like to invite you to test the Talking Stick App! The app moderates conversation between users.

Once you have the app up, we would like you and a friend to run the following scenarios:

Scenario 1

Select 2 as the number of users. Enter a session time (30 minutes is the default but you can choose any number of minutes), and choose the Unlocked mode. You'll be directed to the timer page. When you are ready, the first user A hits Start A, and begins the conversation. When user A finishes speaking, user B presses Start B, and so on, with the conversation going back and forth, and each user pushing their button while speaking, until the time runs out. At any time, users can pause or end the conversation. At the end of the conversation, users are directed to the data analytics page for results.

Scenario 2

Select 2 as the number of users. Enter a session time, and choose the Locked mode. Each user is locked into speaking only for their allotted time (so if you have 2 users and a 2 minute session, each user has 1 minute of speaking time). On the timer page, user A clicks Start A, and begins speaking. When user A finishes speaking, user B presses Start B, and so on, with the conversation going back and forth, and each user pushing their button while speaking, until their individual user time runs out. At any time, users can pause or end the conversation. At the end of the conversation, users are directed to the data analytics page for results.

Please reply back with any bugs or other issues. Thank you so much for testing the Talking Stick App!

Many Thanks - Shadi, Beth and Michelle from AcademyX's Front End Dev Bootcamp
